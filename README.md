# This software implements the algorithm described in "The Frechet Mean of Inhomogeneous Random Graphs"

## You should be able to reproduce Fig. 1, and Fig. 2.


## HOW TO USE THE SOFTWARE

#### In MATLAB, type 

\ >> concentration-frechet

The script will create Fig 1-left, Fig 1-right, and Fig 2-left.

\ >> sharp-threshold

The script will create Fig 2-right.
